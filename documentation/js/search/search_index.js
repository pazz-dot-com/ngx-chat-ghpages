XMPP chat component. It is customizable and offers an API to integrate it with your application.\nFeatures\n\nconnect to XMPP servers via websocket\nsend and receive messages\nload messages from message history (XEP-0313)\nuse the server side buddy list or use your own data source for that, API methods for adding / removing buddies available \nsupports multi user chat\n\nDemo\nHave a look at our demo (valid XMPP credentials required) \n\nDocumentation\nBelow you will find some instructions to getting started. Have a look at the wiki for FAQ's and the API documentation.\nInstallation and usage\nFirst of all, install ngx-chat via npm:\nnpm install --save @pazznetwork/ngx-chat @xmpp/clientAfter that, import it in your root module:\n@NgModule({\n    ...\n    imports: [\n        ...,\n        NgxChatModule.forRoot()\n    ],\n    ...\n})Add the ngx-chat-component at the end of your root component template:\nYou are now ready to go. You will not see anything until you log in.\nLog in via ngx-chat wherever you want (e.g. in a component or a service)\n by injecting ChatService and calling login:\nconstructor(@Inject(ChatServiceToken) chatService: ChatService) {\n    chatService.logIn({\n        domain: 'ngx-chat.example',\n        uri: 'wss://ngx-chat.example:5280/websocket',\n        password: 'password',\n        jid: 'someuser@ngx-chat.example',\n    });\n}Optional: body padding when roster list is expanded\nAdd css styling like the following to your main styles.css if \nyou want to resize your main content when the roster is expanded.\nbody {\n    transition-property: padding-right;\n    transition-duration: 0.4s;\n    padding-right: 0px;\n}\n\nbody.has-roster {\n    padding-right: 14em;\n}FAQ\nQ: Which browsers are supported?\nA: It is tested in Chrome, Safari and Firefox.\nQ: Does ngx-chat work with self signed certificates?\nA: Yes, if the following criteria are met:\n\nthe certificate has to be trusted by the browser you are using. Chrome uses the operating system trust store for certificates while Firefox has a custom implementation.\nthe common name (CN) matches the uri of the service you are connecting to \n\nQ: Can ngx-chat be used without the UI?\nA: Yes. Inject the chat service via @Inject(ChatServiceToken) public chatService: ChatService, login via logIn and start sending messages via the sendMessage method.\nQ: My question is not answered\nA: No problem, feel free to raise an issue.\nDevelopment\nPull requests are welcome!\nIf you want to develop on ngx-chat, clone this repository.\nThe Library can be found in the projects/pazznetwork/ngx-chat folder.\nIn the src folder you find the demo application.\nBuild the plugin\nnpm run build-lib\nRun the plugin tests\nnpm run test:once\nReleasing\nnpm run changelog\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"docs: release $VERSION\"\ngit tag v$VERSION\ngit push origin master --tags\n./push-release.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nCopyright 2018 Alax\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
