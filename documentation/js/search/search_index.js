You will not see anything until you log in.\nLog in via ngx-chat wherever you want (e.g. in a component or a service)\n by injecting ChatService and calling login:\nconstructor(@Inject(ChatServiceToken) chatService: ChatService) {\n    chatService.logIn({\n        domain: 'ngx-chat.example',\n        service: 'wss://ngx-chat.example:5280/websocket',\n        password: 'password',\n        username: 'someuser',\n    });\n}Add the following to polyfills.ts:\n/***************************************************************************************************\n * APPLICATION IMPORTS\n */\n(window as any).global = window;Optional: body padding when roster list is expanded\nAdd css styling like the following to your main styles.css if \nyou want to resize your main content when the roster is expanded.\nbody {\n    transition-property: padding-right;\n    transition-duration: 0.4s;\n    padding-right: 0px;\n}\n\nbody.has-roster {\n    padding-right: 14em;\n}FAQ\nQ: Which browsers are supported?\nA: It is tested in Chrome, Safari and Firefox.\nQ: Does ngx-chat work with self signed certificates?\nA: Yes, if the following criteria are met:\n\nthe certificate has to be trusted by the browser you are using. Chrome uses the operating system trust store for certificates while Firefox has a custom implementation.\nthe common name (CN) matches the uri of the service you are connecting to \n\nQ: Can ngx-chat be used without the UI?\nA: Yes. Inject the chat service via @Inject(ChatServiceToken) public chatService: ChatService, login via logIn and start sending messages via the sendMessage method.\nQ: My question is not answered\nA: No problem, feel free to raise an issue.\nDevelopment\nPull requests are welcome!\nThe source code for ngx-chat can be found in the projects/pazznetwork/ngx-chat folder.\nThe demo application is in the src folder in the project root.  \n# clone this repository\ngit clone git@github.com:pazznetwork/ngx-chat.git\ncd ngx-chat\n\n# install dependencies\nnpm install\n\n# build the library continuously\nng build @pazznetwork/ngx-chat --watch\n\n# (in another terminal) build the sample app continuously\n# will run the demo application on\n# http://localhost:4200\nng serveBuild the plugin\nnpm run build-lib\nRun the plugin tests\nnpm run test:once\nReleasing\n# increment version number in package.json\nVERSION=0.10.4 # change accordingly\nnpm run changelog\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"docs: release $VERSION\"\ngit tag v$VERSION\ngit push origin master --tags\n./push-release.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nCopyright 2020 Pazz GmbH\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
