It is customizable and offers an API to integrate it with your application.\nFeatures\n\nconnect to XMPP servers via websocket\nsend and receive messages\nload messages from message history (XEP-0313)\nuse the server side buddy list or use your own data source for that, API methods for adding / removing buddies available \nsupports multi user chat\n\nCompatibility\n\nAngular 10 (ngx-chat 0.10.x)\nAngular 9 (ngx-chat 0.9.x)\nAngular 8 (ngx-chat 0.4.x)\nAngular 6 (ngx-chat 0.3.x)\nrequires node >= 10.13 && npm >= 5 for build\n\nDemo\nHave a look at our demo (valid XMPP credentials required) \n\nDocumentation\nBelow you will find some instructions to getting started. Have a look at the wiki for FAQ's and the API documentation.\nInstallation and usage\nThis instructions require Angular 10.\nFirst of all, install ngx-chat and its dependencies via npm:\nnpm install --save @pazznetwork/ngx-chat @xmpp/client@~0.9.2 @angular/cdk@~10.0.0After that, import ngx-chat in your root module:\n@NgModule({\n    ...\n    imports: [\n        ...\n        NgxChatModule.forRoot(),\n        BrowserAnimationsModule, // alternatively NoopAnimationsModule \n    ],\n    ...\n})Add the ngx-chat-component at the end of your root component template:\nYou are now ready to go. You will not see anything until you log in.\nLog in via ngx-chat wherever you want (e.g. in a component or a service)\n by injecting ChatService and calling login:\nconstructor(@Inject(ChatServiceToken) ChatService) {\n    chatService.logIn({\n        domain: 'ngx-chat.example',\n        service: 'wss://ngx-chat.example:5280/websocket',\n        password: 'password',\n        username: 'someuser',\n    });\n}Add the following to polyfills.ts:\n/***************************************************************************************************\n * APPLICATION IMPORTS\n */\n(window as any).global = window;Optional: body padding when roster list is expanded\nAdd css styling like the following to your main styles.css if \nyou want to resize your main content when the roster is expanded.\nbody {\n    transition-property: padding-right;\n    transition-duration: 0.4s;\n    padding-right: 0px;\n}\n\nbody.has-roster {\n    padding-right: 14em;\n}FAQ\nQ: Which browsers are supported?\nA: It is tested in Chrome, Safari and Firefox.\nQ: Does ngx-chat work with self signed certificates?\nA: Yes, if the following criteria are met:\n\nthe certificate has to be trusted by the browser you are using. Chrome uses the operating system trust store for certificates while Firefox has a custom implementation.\nthe common name (CN) matches the uri of the service you are connecting to \n\nQ: Can ngx-chat be used without the UI?\nA: Yes.
